# Personal Portfolio

This is the repository for my personal static website that currently houses my CS-relevant projects and papers,although none of them are of publishable quality. The portfolio converges to being a complete personal website, getting built primarily when I want to procratinate on doing more important work.

The website is built starting from <a href="https://muhammadmubeen17.github.io/simple-portfolio-website" target="_blank">this template</a>.
